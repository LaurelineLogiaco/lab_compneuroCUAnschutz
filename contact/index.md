Our group is hosted at the Colorado University Anschutz medical campus, in the [Health Sciences Building](https://news.cuanschutz.edu/news-stories/what-should-i-know-about-the-anschutz-health-sciences-building).

We are embedded in a strong experimental neuroscience community through our affiliation with the [department of Physiology and Biophysics](https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/physiology). We also benefit from an environment that facilitates translational applications to health as we belong to the [University of Colorado Hospital's medical school](https://www.cuanschutz.edu/) and have a secondary affiliation with the [Department of Biomedical Informatics](https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/dbmi).

In addition, we are part of a growing community of computational neuroscientists in the broader Denver area, including the group led by [Tahra Eissa](https://eissalab.com/) in our department, [Mazen Al Borno](https://cse.ucdenver.edu/~alborno/#home) at Colorado University Denver, and [Zachary Kilpatrik](https://www.colorado.edu/amath/zpkilpat) at Colorado University Boulder.
