Our group is hosted at the Colorado University Anschutz medical campus, in the Health Sciences Building.
\
We benefit from a strong experimental neuroscience community through our affiliation with the department of Physiology and Biophysics, as well as a grounding in a translational environment as we belong to the University of Colorado Hospital's medical school and have a secondary affiliation with the Department of Biomedical Informatics.
\
In addition, we are part of a growing community of computational neuroscientists in the broader Denver area, including the group led by [Tahra Eissa](https://eissalab.com/) in our department, [Mazen Al Borno](https://cse.ucdenver.edu/~alborno/#home) at Colorado University Denver, and [Zachary Kilpatrik](https://www.colorado.edu/amath/zpkilpat) at Colorado University Boulder.
