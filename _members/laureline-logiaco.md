Laureline Logiaco studied life sciences, cognitive sciences and computational neuroscience at Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure. She was a graduate student with Angelo Arleo and Wulfram Gerstner, and a postdoctoral researcher with Sean Escola and Larry Abbott at Columbia University. She then received a Simons Transition to Independence award that supported her research at MIT with Ila Fiete, and continues to fund her research at CU Anschutz where she became an assistant professor in 2025. Her research uses a combination of theory, modeling and model-guided data analysis to study the neural network mechanisms supporting the flexible generation of hierarchical behaviors.
