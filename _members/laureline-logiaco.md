Laureline Logiaco is a research scientist at MIT working with Ila Fiete. She studied life sciences, cognitive sciences and computational neuroscience at Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure. She then was a graduate student advised by Angelo Arleo and Wulfram Gerstner, and a postdoctoral researcher with Sean Escola and Larry Abbott at Columbia University. Her research uses a combination of theory, modeling and model-guided data analysis to study the neural network mechanisms supporting the flexible generation of hierarchical behaviors.
