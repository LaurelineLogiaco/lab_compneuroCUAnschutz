Laureline Logiaco studied life sciences, cognitive sciences and computational neuroscience at Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure. She then was a graduate student advised by Angelo Arleo and Wulfram Gerstner, and a postdoctoral researcher with Sean Escola and Larry Abbott at Columbia University. She then became a Simons Transition To Independence fellow and worked at MIT with Ila Fiete during her transition, before starting as an assistant professor at CU Anschutz. Her research uses a combination of theory, modeling and model-guided data analysis to study the neural network mechanisms supporting the flexible generation of hierarchical behaviors.
