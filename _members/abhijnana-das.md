Abhijnana Das studied physics and biology with a concentration in neuroscience during his undergrad at UC Berkeley. He worked as a research assistant in the Umemori lab at Boston Children's Hospital, where he investigated the functions of Protocadherins 10 and 17 in the basal ganglia. He then studied biostatistics for his Master's at the University of Rochester. There, he worked in the Norman-Haignere lab to develop a novel method to examine the latent embeddings of speech in computational models and the brain. He is currently a researcher at the NeCoLe lab at CU Anschutz - his research interests are in analyzing the dynamics of machine learning models and creating new architectures, particularly using ideas inspired from physics and neuroscience. In his spare time, he enjoys working out, going to music festivals, and hiking.
