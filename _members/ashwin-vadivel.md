Ashwin Vadivel earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering from Georgia Tech and Florida State University (FSU) respectively. At FSU, he worked as a research assistant in the Resilient and Autonomous Systems Lab under Dr. Olugbenga Moses Anubi investigating perception methods for autonomous robots. He later worked in industry as a software engineer on the autonomous driving team at Qualcomm and on data center video accelerator products at AMD. He is currently pursuing an MS in Computer Science, serves as a part-time instructor in electronics and programming at Aims Community College, and is a research intern in the NeCoLe Lab at CU Anschutz (Georgia Tech's faculty sponsor: Nabil Imam), where his research interests center on exploring the computational and mechanistic basis of adaptive behavior in biological systems under real-world constraints. Outside the lab, he enjoys maintaining a large saltwater aquarium, hiking and exploring Colorado, and spending time with his dog and cat.
